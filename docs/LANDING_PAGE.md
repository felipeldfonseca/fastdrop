## 🚀 Hero Section

### Headline

**Claim the drop. Beat the dump. Lock in the bag.**

### Sub‑headline

Fast Drop watches the chain 24 / 7 and fires an atomic **claim + market‑sell** transaction the second an airdrop goes live—so you keep the profits, not the bag‑holders.

### Primary CTA

`Get Early Access` → Opens Phantom / Backpack connect modal.

Secondary CTA: `Watch Demo` (60 sec video)

## 🤖 How It Works (3 Steps)

|  Step           |  What happens                                                                                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Connect**  | Link your Phantom or Backpack wallet and choose what % of each airdrop to auto‑sell.                |
| **2. Listen**   | Fast Drop’s claim engine monitors on‑chain events and Discord/Twitter feeds for “claim enabled”.    |
| **3. Cash‑Out** | We submit an atomic claim + Jupiter swap with priority fee, then send you a Telegram/Email receipt. |

## ✨ Why Fast Drop?

* **Milliseconds Matter** – Our TX builder sits on bare‑metal close to main RPC clusters and signs before the crowd.\*
* **Modular Claim Engine** – New airdrop? Drop in a `ClaimAdapter` plugin, no code refactor.
* **Triple Route Fallback** – Jupiter → Meteora → Orca; never miss liquidity.
* **Simulation Mode** – Dry‑run every strategy without risking a single lamport.
* **Security‑First** – Hot key is AES‑encrypted; you alone approve spending caps.

> “I wish I had Fast Drop to sell all my airdrop tokens in the first 15 seconds—I would've made 9× more than what I've made after the price dumped. All my hard work would've been paid off if if I had access to Fast Drop.”

## 🙋‍♂️ FAQ

**Is my private key safe?**
Your spending key is encrypted client‑side; servers only see signed TX.

Fast Drop retries with fallback routes; if all fail, nothing is sold.

**Which airdrops are supported?**
Any SPL token with a public claim program—just add a plugin or request one.
